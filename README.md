# ðŸ§  Awesome ChatGPT Prompts
This is a fork of the main repo [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) adapted to Text Generator Plugin in Obsidian.

Welcome to the "Awesome ChatGPT Prompts"! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The ChatGPT model is a large language model trained by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to add your own prompts to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.


We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!
